## Setup Instructions (for docker) :

1. Download checkpoint 700 file from the gdrive link and unzip inside backend folder : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g5kaK9sm978bn671_g_WywOwuW-Mi_Mg/view?usp=sharing 
2. Install docker if not already present
3. run docker compose up
please ensure that you allocate good amt of cpu to run the backend container.Also docker container perfomance seems to be poor so i currently recommend to run by setting up locally . It takes time but worth it. 

## Setup Instructions (for local) :
Follow the first step from the docker setup then read below 

For both frontend and backend sepreate readme is present inside the folders which contain instruction on setup. The instructions are simple and should not take a lot of time for you tou setup 

## System Req : 
I have tested on the following sepcs : 
M1 (Macbook 13 inch , 16 gib ram )
The model size is small thus u would be able to easily run it on machine having with good processor &  16 gib of ram would work
